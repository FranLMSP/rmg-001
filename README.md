# Rust Boy
A Gameboy emulator written in Rust.

This is just a fun project I'm making for learning and practice purposes. If you want a fully-featured Gameboy emulator, this is not probably the best one :P

Any help or suggestion is welcome!

## TODO
- [x] CPU Registers implementation
- [ ] CPU Instructions implementations
- [ ] PPU implementations
- [ ] Gameboy boot ROM
- [ ] Render the pixels
- [ ] Gameboy Color compatibility
- [ ] Sound
