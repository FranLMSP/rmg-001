Yet Another Rust Gameboy Emulator.

This is just a fun project I'm making for learning and practice purposes. If you want a fully-featured Gameboy emulator, this is not probably the best one :P

Any help or suggestion is welcome!

## TODO
- [x] CPU Registers implementation
- [x] CPU Instructions implementations
- [ ] Interrupts
- [ ] Timing
- [ ] PPU implementations
- [ ] Gameboy boot ROM
- [ ] Render the pixels
- [ ] Gameboy Color compatibility
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Web Assembly support (because this is a Rust project and it has to support Web Assembly)
